# Linear Regression Project
In this project we will build a linear regression model to predict the insurance prima for an individual based on different factors.

The dataset used for this project can be obtained from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/linear-regression-project-tutorial/main/medical_insurance_cost.csv).

[Here](src/explore.ipynb) you can find the exploratory data analysis maded to find patterns and get insights from the data.

And [here](src/app.py) you can find the final cleaning process, the model construction, and the pipeline creation.
